## About Me

I earned a bachelor of science degree in neuroscience from Michigan State University. I am currently in pursuit of a master's of science degree in biostatistics from Grand Valley State University. 

## Research Interest

I have always had an interest in human biology. After I earned my bachelor's degree, I moved to Grand Rapids and began working as a research technician at the Van Andel Institute researching genetics in cardiovascular tissue repair. I remain an inter for my master's program working for the same cardiovascular laboratory studying the genetics and proteomics of cardiomyocyte renewal. 


## Future Goals

After earning my master's degree, I plan to pursue a career in statistics. My goal is to move out of Michigan and explore the USA with the love of my life and my loyal best friend, Loki.

## Hobbies

My favorite hobby is cooking. I also enjoy snowboarding, going to see live music, and hiking. I would like to travel the U.S. in search of the most beautiful hiking adventures and finest cuisine.
